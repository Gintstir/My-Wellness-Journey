    <p> We designed this website to be used by people on all walks of life looking for moments of reflection and
        introspection. The creators found themselves feeling a little more stressed than blessed at work and decided to
        catalyze this energy by making an app that checked in with some of their core tenets of wellness: mood,
        hydration,
        and movement. We encourage you to take 5 minutes with our app once a day to reflect on your positivity, practice
        some quick adjustable (there‚Äôs a better word for this) exercises, and drink some water! As you log your mood a
        chart
        will be automatically generated so you can observe trends in your positivity over time. Exercises are available
        on
        the main page and can be performed stand-alone or as a circuit; we suggest you try two on your first trip. We
        hope
        the hydration reminder will bring a smile to your face.
        Thank you for visiting our website, and all the best to you on your wellness journey
    </p>
