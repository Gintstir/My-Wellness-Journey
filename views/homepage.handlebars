                     Place your back flush with a wall and shimmy down while adjusting your feet until your knees
                    form a 90 degree angle. Increase the angle for a lighter burn and hold until you can't.</p>

                    <br><br>
                     From standing bring your arms out to your side palms down. Make this easier by bending your arms at
                    a 90 degree angle from your elbows (palms will still face down). After a few breaths you can rotate
                    your forearms so that your palms face forward or up. for an additional stretch. Try to hold for 5
                    deep breaths, then release. </p>

                    Lay down on your back. Hinge at the hip to raise both legs to a 90 degree angle, there can be a
                    light bend in the knee, but keep them as straight as possible. Slowly lower one leg (still straight)
                    until your heel is 1 inch off the ground, hold for one breath, then switch legs. Go until you can't!</p>

                    Take a seat on the ground, extend both arms forward palms down and place the soles of your feet on
                    the ground so your heels are just in front of your fingertips. Hinge backwards from your hips while
                    maintaining a straight back until you just begin shaking. Hold for 5 deep breaths. The lower your
                    arms are, the easier this will be.</p>

                    Avoid this one if you have bad knees, wrists, or hips. Bring yourself onto your hands and knees so
                    that your palms are directly under your shoulders and your knees are under your hips. Lengthen your
                    spine, relax your neck, and raise your knees 2 inches off the ground. Hold for 5 deep breaths.</p>

                    You'll need a table, filing cabinet or stationary chair (not wheeled!).  With back to whatever you're using,
                    place palms flat on surface, bend elbows straight back and lower yourself straight down until your elbow forms
                    a 90 degree angle.  Then straighten your arms and rise back to start. Do as many as possible within the time.</p>

                    Stand behind a chair or near a wall if you need support.  Raise your heels off the floor until you are standing
                    on your toes. Slowly lower yourself back to the floor.  For an extra challenge, stand with your toes on the edge of a step
                    or any sturdy raised surface.</p>

                    This can be done seated or standing.  Sit or stand up tall, as if you're balancing a glass of water
                    on your head. Engage your core, then pinch your shoulder blades together(imagine squeezing a pencil between them).
                    Relax and repeat.</p>

                    Start by grabbing your right forearm with your left hand. Slowly make circles with your right wrist.
                    Make four circles clockwise and then counter clockwise.  Repeat all of this on the left wrist. </p>

                    Sitting upright in your chair, cross your right ankle over your left knee. Flex your right foot,
                    and feel a stretch in your right glute and outer hip. If you donâ€™t feel a stretch, slowly hinge
                    forward at your waist and lean into the right hip. Hold for 20-30 seconds, then switch sides.</p>
