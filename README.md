## **User-Story**

```
AS AN exhausted boot camp student,
I WANT to see funny .Gifs,
SO THAT I am reminded to drink enough water throughout the day.

AS A stay-at-home parent,
I WANT to see data about me displayed intuitively,
SO THAT I can keep track of my moods, and my mental health.

AS AN office worker,
I WANT to do a quick exercise or stretch,
SO THAT I can recenter and refocus myself and return to work.
```
